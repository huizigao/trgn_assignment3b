## ensg2hugo.py
### usage:
"wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz"
at first, users should use this command to download this gtf file, then use comman gunzip this file.
then, input the command "python3 ensg2hugo.py [-f][0-9] [file]", the number following '-f' means the order of the colume contains gene id in a specific file including gene information.
### description:
this program can replace gene_id with the hugo name of the gene in a specific file. 
### limit:
users should download the Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf file instead of Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.75.gtf since I edited this program based on the gene_id without decimal points.
### known issues:
A reasonable output is not effectively returned if the only argument entered by the user is a filename.
